This sample demonstrates how to deploy empty folders on the target system.Execute corresponding .cmd file to build desired msi. Then execute the .msi to start the installation.When working with raw Wix you cannot have empty directories. Every directory must have either component (e.g. File) or special element CreateFolder. See http://www.mail-archive.com/wix-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01930.htmlWix# does not have such limitation as it simply creates all necessary syntactical decoration (injects CreateFolder element) in Wix source file automatically when empty directory declaration is detected.
