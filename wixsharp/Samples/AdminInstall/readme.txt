This sample demonstrates how to define various Managed Custom Actions and place them in the appropriate execution sequences.Execute corresponding .cmd file to build desired msi. Then execute the *Install.cmd to start the installation.In this example Managed CAs just show MessageBox and print into setup log file. Note that MyAdminAction is placed in the AdminExecuteSequence allowing it to be invoked when MSI is launched as AdminInstall (msiexec /a *.msi). This sample demonstrates only how to ensure a proper setting up of the AdminExecuteSequence but not to to prepare a complete AdminInstall MSI.
