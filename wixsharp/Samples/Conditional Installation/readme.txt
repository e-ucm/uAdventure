This sample demonstrates how to define conditional components (e.g. shortcuts).Execute corresponding build.cmd file to build msi. Then execute the .msi to start the installation.During the installation setup will prompt user to indicate if shortcut to the application should be created on desktop.Note that if the install condition for the component can be set without iteracting with user (e.g. analysing registry)as part InstallExecuteSequence. However if interaction is required (e.g. message box, checkbox) install condition should be set form InstallUISequence.
