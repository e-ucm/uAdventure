This sample demonstrates how to inject raw XML (dialog images) into WiX code generated by Wix# compiler. It is possible to set background images directly on Wix# project class (see UIDialogBackground sample) but this sample demonstrates and alternative techniquewhich allows you to inject whole WiX XML statements just before building the msi.Execute corresponding .cmd file to build desired msi. Then execute the .msi to start the installation.
