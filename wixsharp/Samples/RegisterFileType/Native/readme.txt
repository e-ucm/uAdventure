This sample demonstrates how to register File Type association with the application being installed.Execute corresponding .cmd file to build desired msi. Then execute the Install.cmd to start the installation.Note: The default values of the FileAssociation fields are for trivial "open" shell operation. Thus the following two statements are equal: new FileAssociation("my", "application/my", "open", "\"%1\"") new FileAssociation("my")
