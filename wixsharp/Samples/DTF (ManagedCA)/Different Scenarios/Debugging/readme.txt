This sample demonstrates how to debug Managed Custom Actions.Execute corresponding .cmd file to build desired msi. Then execute the Install.cmd to start the installation.Note that Build.cmd passes /d (debug switch) to the script engine cscs.exe. This forces Custom Action assembly to include debug information and fire the breakpoint in MyAction method. When prompted select desired debuggerand (e.g. Visual Studio 2008) and press F10 to jump in the source file setup.cs.
