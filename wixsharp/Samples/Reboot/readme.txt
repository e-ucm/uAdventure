This example demonstrates how to reboot system after the installation. 
Instead of using traditional MSI approach you can use Managed CA. In this case you have ability to 
do this in a bit user friendlier manner (e.g. show custom message, use reboot timeout).
    	
Execute corresponding .cmd file to build desired msi. After msi is built execute it. 
Note: this will reboot the system.
