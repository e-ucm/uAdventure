These example demonstrate different coding styles/techniques for defining Wix# script:
 1. traditional.cs - plain C# routine
 2. initializers.cs - class instantiation with C# 3.0 initializers
 3. xDocument.cs - XDocument style class instantiation 
 
The examples are intended to illustrate coding styles only. Thus they are rather a code snippets then fully working code samples.
