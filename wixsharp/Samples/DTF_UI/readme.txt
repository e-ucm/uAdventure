This sample demonstrates how to define Managed Custom Actions that displays managed input form, collects user input and assigns it to the MSI property.Execute corresponding .cmd file to build desired msi. Then execute the Install.cmd to start the installation.In this examples Managed CA just shows input form where you can enter the string value for the WEBPOOL_NAME property. The example uses QtCmdLineAction CA to start notepad.exe with the parameter entered by used in the input form.When used in the actual deployment scenario you may want to handle silent mode in some special way. new Condition("(NOT Installed) AND (UILevel > 3)")) //condition for executing some action during the installation but only if it is not silent mode (UILevel > 3)
